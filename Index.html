      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">My whole life is about serving others - customer satisfaction is my focus for both values and practices. I've had 10 years of business experience to bring it to life: to create, innovate, grow and develop it.

I worked in many assigned roles but with great success in specialized, autonomous, leadership roles. Essentially my management skills - managing a work, or managing people - are my best customer satisfaction tools.

 I'm currently in a transition period growing forward towards personal development. Having moved from St. John's to Halifax, I had been working for the Alt Hotel St. John's as Front Office Supervisor. The Alt Hotel afforded me the ability to innovate and create - in addition to leading a strong team of 10, (and sometimes more) like-minded, cooperative and valued individuals - and I've enjoyed great customer satisfaction outcomes.

 On my journey of success, I've discovered that I'd like to take on a more entrepreneurial role, that I love coffee, hospitality overall, and working with people. I love learning, experimentation, adventure, but above all, engaging others, even in the most challenging circumstances.

Currently, I'm envisioning a new business with coffee and happy people in it and teaching myself HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. If you are interested in working with me, then please feel free to contact me. I'd love to have a conversation with you. </p>
